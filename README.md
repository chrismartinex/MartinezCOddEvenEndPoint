//Odd or Even Number End Point 
// https://localhost:****/OddEven/OddorEven/{numeros}
//Peer Review: Freddy Aguila The program takes mini challenge  and turns it into an API program. The user inputs a number and when it is typed into the url on Postman it tells you whether your number was odd or even. The program runs successfully and the code is formatted nice and neat. GOOD JOB!
